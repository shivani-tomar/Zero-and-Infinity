# Invention of zero :-

Zero is given by the great Indian Mathematian and physicict ARYABhATTA in his living time studying in Takshila. He not only give Zero to maths which is a great cotribution in mathematical world But also enhance mathematical world by calculating value of PI which is used in area and parameter  calculation of circle . He wrote a book named "AryaBhatiaya" in which he lined up all his invention and contribution to the mathematical world. He was the only one who break the illusion about solar and lunar ecllipse. And today's time travelling theory given by stephen hawking was first introduce by him by giving example of river and boat flowing in it. but some how example was considered wrong so this theory was considered wrong  and was not recognised . But the example of correct and again introduced by stephen hawking by saying "Time is a dimesion with which we are flowing ". 


# History of maths : = 
Before the invention of zero there are only nine numbers from 1 to 9 . There all the calculation done only on the basis of these nine numbers which is only distribution nothing else. Maths was totally nothing without zero as the countings are only nine. People only count only 9 numbers and then nothing. But after the invention of zero, a big expansion is done in mathematical world. After the invention of zero counting proceeds after nine and it is non-terminating countings.


# Contribution of zero in maths : -

The contribution of zero in maths is very large and vital. Nobody can ignore its presence as it not only proceeds counting but also give mathematical operators like addtion, subtraction , division and multiplication. All the logics of factors and like LCM and HCF comes only because of zero. Lets unedrstand theses importances through an example.

## Addtion  : - 

Before the invention of zero  4+5 = 9 but what about 9+3 or 9+4 . what will be the result of these addions as nobody knows 12 or 13 in Maths. they only know 1-9 digits only. 

same with "subtraction" and "division" as well as "multiplication". Factors , LCM , HCF... nobody knows about them . SO all these things comes after the invention of zero.

## What is ZERO : - 

Before understanding importance of zero  , first we need to understand what is zero. Zero is not a digit like others 1-9. Its a magical digit with a terminating point and initializing point. To understand this, have a look on counting from 1-100. After writing 1-9 we put 0 as terminator after one and then start same counting with having a constant one Then 2 with 0 and 2 become constant and then 3 so on... thats why counting is a pattern. 

SO ZERO is neither a factor of any digit nor multiple. It is a initiatitor and terminator pattern. This is the main reason that divide and multiply by zero is always zero. 0/0 is undefined and division zero exception we get in computers is because of this.

In short "0" is a pattern that revolutionze the mathematical world.

# Enhancement in maths : - 

SO, I hope you understand zero very well. Now its time , to count its importance and contribution in maths.

You understand  it very well that we can write counting from where to where we want to write. There is no limit to write counting as counting is only a pattern noting else. So, we want a terminating point to stop our counting . 

If you look at for example from 1-100 countings , then you will be able to find out tables from 2-10 . and division - multiplication is based on tables. you are also able to see arithimatic progression and geomatric progression. SO, these are also because of zero. Prime numbers and non prome numbers are also because of zero. The whole number system and its application are beacuase of zero. Statistical maths , probability ,  mean , mode meadian all are becasue of zero as its initializing countings. 


Contribution of zero cannot be forget as becasue of it all mathematian are there and whole maths is there as maths is number and numbers are given by ARYABHATTA. 

All thanks go to ARYABHTTA...
