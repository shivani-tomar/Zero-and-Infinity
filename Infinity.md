# ABOUT INFINITE AND SHRINIWASA RAMANUJA

You understand  it very well that we can write counting from where to where we want to write. There is no limit to write counting as counting is only a pattern noting else. So, we want a terminating point to stop our counting . That's why SHRINIWASSA RAMANUJA gives infinite to maths

He was to only one who recognize pattern in counting and give arithimatice progession, geomatric progression and harmonic progression to maths with their formulas which are so much perfect that we can find sum of this pattern and Nth number very finely. 

"PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION" was his contribution to the mathematical world. through we find shortcut formulas for any pattern. 

He solves thousands of patterns and give many shortcut formulas to these patterns which are so accurate that the mathematician "G.H. Hardy" was so surprized how he found these patterns and formulas. He solves about 32, 000 equations of maths which is very large in numbers.
